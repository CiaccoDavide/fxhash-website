On the 1st of April 2022, **The Big Burn** happened. All the remaining editions of the projects published during the beta were burnt, effectively ending the beta of the platform. No more beta token will ever be generated past this event.


## What's The Big Burn

The `mint()` entry point of the current generative token contract was locked, making it impossible to mint new NFTs from existing projects. To be precise, editions were not burnt on-chain on the 1st of April, but when the new contract will be deployed, projects will be transfered without any supply left. So effectively, it's as if they were burnt on the 1st of April.

The API *hacks* the remaining supply served to the front-end (making it 0), so that it translates the state of the projects in advance.


## What's next

In the upcoming weeks, most likely mid-April, we will release the new version of fxhash, the official one this time. Many (many) new features on the horizon...
